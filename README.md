# 📖 God's Word Poster Studio

An elegant, browser-based application designed to create high-quality daily blessing posters for WhatsApp, Telegram, and Social Media.

## ✨ Features

* **Auto-Formatting Intelligence:** Simply paste your message. The app automatically identifies the Verse, Reference, Short Message, and uses the 3rd line as a specialized **Prayer Title**.

* **Visual Active Indicators:** A premium **Gold Border** highlights exactly which preset from your gallery is currently live on the poster.
* **One-Tap Workspace Reset:** Includes a **"Clear Message"** button to instantly wipe the text area and reset the poster to default placeholders for your next design.
* **Local Storage (IndexedDB):** Saves your background presets and profile pictures directly in your browser. This allows for high-capacity storage without needing a cloud account.
* **Offline Ready:** Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA). Install it on your phone and use it anywhere, even without an internet connection.
* **Privacy Focused:** All image processing and storage happen locally on your device. Your photos and text are never uploaded to a server.
